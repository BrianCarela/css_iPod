## iPod Classic


## Setup

Work to draw an iPod Classic using HTML/CSS. Some questions to ask yourself:
- Do people still use iPods?
- What does an iPod Classic look like?
- What are the physical features of an iPod Classic?
- What shapes are those features?
- Should we wireframe this? (...yes)

No files have been provided for you this time - you'll need to create an ` index.html `, a ` styles.css `, link the CSS stylesheet to the HTML, and open the HTML in your browser.

## Completion

Get as far as you can! At the end of this session, you will share an image of your creation with the class, so get creative!

## Assignment

#### Step 1 - Command Line
- In the appropriate folder, make a directory called `css_ipod` and navigate into this directory.
- Make an HTML file called `index.html`.
- Make a CSS file called `style.css`.
- Open these files in your text editor.  
- Open `index.html` in Chrome.

#### Step 2 - File Structure

- Setup your `index.html` boilerplate. Please type this into your file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CSS iPod!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 3 - Draw a basic iPod!

Some pointers/pro-tips/resources:

- How do you make a circle in CSS?
```css
#wheel {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
- What are some useful CSS properties we may or may not have covered yesterday? Take a moment to look them up!
-- margin, padding, height and width in %, background-color, background-image, color, border (border-width, border-style, border-color), display, position, 

- Break down the example iPod picture in terms of its visual components.
- Think about how to lay these components within/on top of each other.
- [Colors](http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/) <--- A GREAT CSS Website!
- [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Examples)

#### Step 4 (Make it your iPod!)

- Change the screen content to have a sweet image/GIF.
- iPod's used to be in many wacky colors!
- Use borders to make it have a more 3-D look/feel.
